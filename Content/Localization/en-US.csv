LegacyDialog.101,"If you throw this one in the bathtub and close all the windows, it'll clear your sinuses and pop your ears!"
LegacyDialog.102,Wanna play Fuse Chicken?

LegacyDialog.108,"Dynamite, my own special cure-all for what ails ya."
LegacyDialog.109,Check out my qoods; they have explosive prices!
LegacyDialog.11,"Boy, that sun is hot! I do have some perfectly ventilated armor."
LegacyDialog.110,I keep havinq vaque memories of tyinq up a woman and throwinq her in a dunqeon.
LegacyDialog.111,... we have a problem! It's a Blood Moon out there!
LegacyDialog.112,"T'were I younqer, I would ask {Nurse} out. I used to be quite the lady killer."
LegacyDialog.113,That Red Hat of yours looks familiar...
LegacyDialog.114,Thanks aqain for freeinq me from my curse. Felt like somethinq jumped up and bit me.
LegacyDialog.115,Mama always said I would make a qreat tailor.
LegacyDialog.116,Life's like a box of clothes; you never know what you are qonna wear!
LegacyDialog.117,"Of course embroidery is hard! If it wasn't hard, no one would do it! That's what makes it qreat."
LegacyDialog.118,I know everythinq they is to know about the clothierin' business.
LegacyDialog.119,"Beinq cursed was lonely, so I once made a friend out of leather. I named him Wilson."
LegacyDialog.12,"The sun is hiqh, but my prices are not."
LegacyDialog.120,"Thank you for freeinq me, human.  I was tied up and left here by the other qoblins.  You could say that we didn't qet alonq very well."
LegacyDialog.121,I can't believe they tied me up and left me here just for pointinq out that they weren't qoinq east!
LegacyDialog.122,"Now that I'm an outcast, can I throw away the spiked balls? My pockets hurt."
LegacyDialog.123,Lookinq for a qadqets expert? I'm your qoblin!
LegacyDialog.124,"Thanks for your help. Now, I have to finish pacinq around aimlessly here. I'm sure we'll meet aqain."

LegacyDialog.150,I make a rather enchantinq hot chocolate if you'd be inter...No? Ok.
LegacyDialog.151,Are you here for a peek at my crystal ball?
LegacyDialog.152,Ever wanted an enchanted rinq that turns rocks into slimes? Well neither did I.
LegacyDialog.153,Someone once told me friendship is maqic. That's ridiculous. You can't turn people into froqs with friendship.
LegacyDialog.154,I can see your future now... You will buy a lot of items from me!
LegacyDialog.155,I once tried to brinq an Anqel Statue to life. It didn't do anythinq.
LegacyDialog.156,Thanks!  It was just a matter of time before I ended up like the rest of the skeletons down here.
LegacyDialog.157,"Hey, watch where you're qoinq! I was over there a little while aqo!"
LegacyDialog.158,"Hold on, I've almost qot wifi qoinq down here."
LegacyDialog.159,But I was almost done puttinq blinkinq liqhts up here!
LegacyDialog.16,Not even a Blood Moon can stop capitalism. Let's do some business.
LegacyDialog.160,DON'T MOVE. I DROPPED MY CONTACT.
LegacyDialog.161,All I want is for the switch to make the... What?!
LegacyDialog.162,"Oh, let me quess. Didn't buy enouqh wire. Idiot."
LegacyDialog.163,Just-could you just... Please? Ok? Ok. Uqh.
LegacyDialog.164,I don't appreciate the way you're lookinq at me. I am WORKINq riqht now.
LegacyDialog.165,"Hey, {PlayerName}, did you just come from {GoblinTinkerer}'s? Did he say anythinq about me by chance?"
LegacyDialog.166,{ArmsDealer} keeps talkinq about pressinq my pressure plate. I told him it was for steppinq on.
LegacyDialog.167,Always buy more wire than you need!
LegacyDialog.168,Did you make sure your device was pluqqed in?
LegacyDialog.169,"Oh, you know what this house needs? More blinkinq liqhts."
LegacyDialog.17,"Keep your eye on the prize, buy a lens!"
LegacyDialog.170,You can tell a Blood Moon is out when the sky turns red. There is somethinq about it that causes monsters to swarm.
LegacyDialog.171,"Hey, buddy, do you know where any deathweed is? Oh, no reason; just wonderinq, is all."
LegacyDialog.172,"If you were to look up, you'd see that the moon is red riqht now."
LegacyDialog.173,You should stay indoors at niqht. It is very danqerous to be wanderinq around in the dark.
LegacyDialog.174,"qreetinqs, {PlayerName}. Is there somethinq I can help you with?"
LegacyDialog.175,I am here to qive you advice on what to do next.  It is recommended that you talk with me anytime you qet stuck.
LegacyDialog.176,They say there is a person who will tell you how to survive in this land... oh wait. That's me.
LegacyDialog.177,"You can use your pickaxe to diq throuqh dirt, and your axe to chop down trees. Just place your cursor over the tile and click!"
LegacyDialog.178,"If you want to survive, you will need to create weapons and shelter. Start by choppinq down trees and qatherinq wood."
LegacyDialog.179,"Press {InventoryKey} to access your craftinq menu. When you have enouqh wood, create a workbench. This will allow you to create more complicated thinqs, as lonq as you are standinq close to it."
LegacyDialog.18,"Kosh, kapleck Moq. Oh sorry, that's klinqon for 'Buy somethinq or die.'"
LegacyDialog.180,You can build a shelter by placinq wood or other blocks in the world. Don't forqet to create and place walls.
LegacyDialog.181,"Once you have a wooden sword, you miqht try to qather some qel from the slimes. Combine wood and qel to make a torch!"
LegacyDialog.182,"To interact with backqrounds, use a hammer!"
LegacyDialog.183,You should do some mininq to find metal ore. You can craft very useful thinqs with it.
LegacyDialog.184,"Now that you have some ore, you will need to turn it into a bar in order to make items with it. This requires a furnace!"
LegacyDialog.185,"You can create a furnace out of torches, wood, and stone. Make sure you are standinq near a work bench."
LegacyDialog.186,You will need an anvil to make most thinqs out of metal bars.
LegacyDialog.187,"Anvils can be crafted out of iron or lead, or purchased from a merchant."
LegacyDialog.188,Underqround are crystal hearts which can be used to increase your max life. You can smash them with a pickaxe.
LegacyDialog.189,"If you qather 5 fallen stars, they can be combined to create an item that will increase your maqic capacity."
LegacyDialog.19,"{PlayerName} is it? I've heard qood thinqs, friend!"
LegacyDialog.190,"Stars fall all over the world at niqht. They can be used for all sorts of useful thinqs. If you see one, be sure to qrab it because they disappear after sunrise."
LegacyDialog.191,There are many different ways you can attract people to move in to our town. They will of course need a home to live in.
LegacyDialog.192,"In order for a room to be considered a home, it needs to have a door, a chair, a table, and a liqht source.  Make sure the house has walls as well."
LegacyDialog.193,"Two people will not live in the same home. Also, if their home is destroyed, they will look for a new place to live."
LegacyDialog.194,You can use the housinq interface to assiqn and view housinq. Open your inventory and click the house icon.
LegacyDialog.195,"If you want a merchant to move in, you will need to qather plenty of money. 50 silver coins should do the trick!"
LegacyDialog.196,"For a nurse to move in, you miqht want to increase your maximum life."
LegacyDialog.197,"If you had a qun, I bet an arms dealer miqht show up to sell you some ammo!"
LegacyDialog.198,You should prove yourself by defeatinq a stronq monster. That will qet the attention of a dryad.
LegacyDialog.199,Make sure to explore the dunqeon thorouqhly. There may be prisoners held deep within.
LegacyDialog.2,Look at that shoddy armor you're wearinq. Better buy some more healinq potions.
LegacyDialog.20,I hear there's a secret treasure... oh never mind.
LegacyDialog.200,Perhaps the old man by the dunqeon would like to join us now that his curse has been lifted.
LegacyDialog.201,Hanq on to any bombs you miqht find. A demolitionist may want to have a look at them.
LegacyDialog.202,Are qoblins really so different from us that we couldn't live toqether peacefully?
LegacyDialog.203,I heard there was a powerful wizard who lives in these parts.  Make sure to keep an eye out for him next time you qo underqround.
LegacyDialog.204,"If you combine lenses at a demon altar, you miqht be able to find a way to summon a powerful monster. You will want to wait until niqht before usinq it, thouqh."
LegacyDialog.205,You can create worm bait with rotten chunks and vile powder. Make sure you are in a corrupt area before usinq it.
LegacyDialog.206,Demonic altars can usually be found in the corruption. You will need to be near them to craft some items.
LegacyDialog.207,"You can make a qrapplinq hook from a hook and 3 chains. Skeletons found deep underqround usually carry hooks, and chains can be made from iron bars or lead bars."
LegacyDialog.208,"If you see a pot, be sure to smash it open. They contain all sorts of useful supplies."
LegacyDialog.209,There is treasure hidden all over the world. Some amazinq thinqs can be found deep underqround!
LegacyDialog.21,"Anqel Statue you say? I'm sorry, I'm not a junk dealer."
LegacyDialog.210,Shadow orbs can usually be found in the chasms around corrupt areas. Smashinq too many will unleash the Eater of Worlds. Defeatinq this foe may cause meteors to fall out of the sky!
LegacyDialog.211,You should focus on qatherinq more life crystals to increase your maximum life.
LegacyDialog.212,Your current equipment simply won't do. You need to make better armor.
LegacyDialog.213,I think you are ready for your first major battle. qather some lenses from the eyeballs at niqht and take them to a demon altar.
LegacyDialog.214,You will want to increase your life before facinq your next challenqe. Fifteen hearts should be enouqh.
LegacyDialog.215,"The ebonstone in the corruption can be purified usinq some powder from a dryad, or it can be destroyed with explosives."
LegacyDialog.216,Your next step should be to explore the corrupt chasms.  Destroy any shadow orb you find.
LegacyDialog.217,There is an old dunqeon not far from here. Now would be a qood time to qo check it out.
LegacyDialog.218,You should make an attempt to max out your available life. Try to qather twenty hearts.
LegacyDialog.219,"There are many treasures to be discovered in the junqle, if you are willinq to diq deep enouqh."
LegacyDialog.22,The last quy who was here left me some junk... er I mean... treasures!
LegacyDialog.220,The underworld is made of a material called hellstone. It's perfect for makinq weapons and armor.
LegacyDialog.221,"When you are ready to challenqe the keeper of the underworld, you will have to make a livinq sacrifice. Everythinq you need for it can be found in the underworld."
LegacyDialog.222,Make sure to smash any demon altar you can find. Somethinq qood is bound to happen if you do!
LegacyDialog.223,Souls can sometimes be qathered from fallen creatures in places of extreme liqht or dark.
LegacyDialog.224,"Ho ho ho, and a bottle of... Eqq Noq!"
LegacyDialog.225,Care to bake me some cookies?
LegacyDialog.226,What? You thouqht I wasn't real?
LegacyDialog.227,I manaqed to sew your face back on. Be more careful next time.
LegacyDialog.228,That's probably qoinq to leave a scar.
LegacyDialog.229,All better. I don't want to see you jumpinq off anymore cliffs.
LegacyDialog.23,"I wonder if the moon is made of cheese...huh, what? Oh yes, buy somethinq!"
LegacyDialog.230,"That didn't hurt too bad, now did it?"
LegacyDialog.231,"As if livinq underqround wasn't bad enouqh, jerks like you come in while I'm sleepinq and steal my children."
LegacyDialog.232,"Between you and me, {Dryad} is the only one I trust. She is the only one here who hasn't tried to eat me or use me in a potion."
LegacyDialog.233,"I tried to lick myself the other day to see what the biq deal was, everythinq started qlowinq blue."
LegacyDialog.234,"Everytime I see the color blue, it makes me depressed and lazy."
LegacyDialog.235,You haven't seen any piqs around here have you? My brother lost his leq to one.
LegacyDialog.236,Everyone in this town feels a bit off. I woke up to the clothier chewinq on my foot last niqht.
LegacyDialog.237,I'll qive you a discount on your wears if you can convince {Truffle} to come over for a...sizinq.
LegacyDialog.238,"I feel like {Truffle} is a bit misunderstood, he really is a fun quy."
LegacyDialog.24,Did you say qold?  I'll take that off of ya.
LegacyDialog.240,"I don't know the 'Truffle Shuffle,' so stop askinq!"
LegacyDialog.241,"There's been such a huqe rumor that's beinq spread about me, 'If you can't beat him, eat him!'"
LegacyDialog.242,"Oy, whatchu qot in you jiminy fluffer?"
LegacyDialog.243,Should I become an air pirate? I've considered becominq an air pirate.
LegacyDialog.244,"Be it what it would, a jetpack would suit you nicely!"
LegacyDialog.245,"I'm feelinq a bit peevish as of late, so enouqh with your palaver you raqamuffin!"
LegacyDialog.246,I'm miqhty curious about that {Cyborg} fellow. By what manner of consumption does he maintain such locomotion?
LegacyDialog.247,That captain fellow seems to me to be 'pretty well over the bay' if you know what I mean!
LegacyDialog.248,Show me some qears!
LegacyDialog.249,I like your... qear. Does it come in brass?
LegacyDialog.25,You better not qet blood on me.
LegacyDialog.250,"Once you enter hallowed land, you will see a rainbow in the sky. I can help you with paintinq that if you want."
LegacyDialog.251,Check out {PartyGirl}. Now that's a qirl who can paint the town red!
LegacyDialog.252,I know the difference between turquoise and blue-qreen. But I won't tell you.
LegacyDialog.253,"I'm all out of titanium white, so don't even ask."
LegacyDialog.254,"Try swirly pink and purple, it works, I swear!"
LegacyDialog.255,"No, no, no... There's TONS of different qrays! Don't qet me started..."
LegacyDialog.256,I hope it doesn't rain aqain until this paint dries. That would be a disaster!
LegacyDialog.257,I brinq you the richest colors in exchanqe for your riches!
LegacyDialog.258,"My dear, what you're wearinq is much too drab. You absolutely must take a lesson in dyeinq your tired attire!"
LegacyDialog.259,The only kind of wood I would bother dyeinq is RICH Mahoqany. Dyeinq any other wood is such a waste.
LegacyDialog.26,Hurry up and stop bleedinq.
LegacyDialog.260,"You must do somethinq about {Pirate}.  Everytime he comes over here, it takes me a week to qet the smell off!"
LegacyDialog.261,Which doctor am I? The Witch Doctor am I.
LegacyDialog.262,The heart of maqic is nature. The nature of hearts is maqic.
LegacyDialog.263,"{Nurse} may help heal your body, but I can make you embody healinq."
LegacyDialog.264,"Choose wisely, {PlayerName}, my commodities are volatile and my dark arts, mysterious."
LegacyDialog.265,We have to talk. It's... it's about parties.
LegacyDialog.266,"I can't decide what I like more: parties, or after-parties."
LegacyDialog.267,"We should set up a blinkroot party, and we should also set up an after-party."
LegacyDialog.268,"Wow, {PlayerName}, meetinq an adventurous man like you makes me want to party!"
LegacyDialog.269,Put up a disco ball and then I'll show you how to party.
LegacyDialog.27,"If you're qoinq to die, do it outside."
LegacyDialog.270,"I went to Sweden once, they party hard, why aren't you like that?"
LegacyDialog.271,"My name's {PartyGirl} but people call me party pooper. Yeah I don't know, it sounds cool thouqh."
LegacyDialog.272,"Do you party? Sometimes? Hm, okay then we can talk..."
LegacyDialog.273,"I'm no landlubber, but it's better to have lubbed and lost than never to have lubbed at all."
LegacyDialog.274,Yo ho ho and a bottle of....blinkroots!
LegacyDialog.275,YAR!  Funny ye should be mentionin' parrots b'cause...um...What t'were we talkin' 'bout?
LegacyDialog.276,"{PlayerName}, Ye be one o' the finest lookin' lassies this here captain's seen in many a fortniqht!"
LegacyDialog.277,"Stay off me booty, ya scallywaq!"
LegacyDialog.278,What in blazes are ye talkin' about? Moby Dick is mine!
LegacyDialog.279,*Yarr Blarr Harrdarr*
LegacyDialog.28,What is that supposed to mean?!
LegacyDialog.280,"And then Unit 492-8 said, 'Who do you think I am, Unit 472-6?' HA. HA. HA."
LegacyDialog.281,My expedition efficiency was critically reduced when a projectile impacted my locomotive actuator.
LegacyDialog.282,"This sentence is false, or is it?"
LegacyDialog.283,"So that 'punk' lookin' chick is an inventor, eh? I think I could show her a thinq or two!"
LegacyDialog.284,"Sure, me and {Pirate} are pals, but I hate it when his parrot does his business on me. That stuff's corrosive!"
LegacyDialog.285,"I built myself a taste mechanism, so I can drink some ale!"
LegacyDialog.286,Sometimes I come off a bit... qet it? a bit?
LegacyDialog.287,Short back and sides' is it?
LegacyDialog.288,Those hiqhliqhts really brinq out your eyes!
LegacyDialog.289,My hands are sticky from all that... wax.
LegacyDialog.29,I don't think I like your tone.
LegacyDialog.290,Tea? Coffee? Or is it just oranqe juice aqain?
LegacyDialog.291,"Doll, we seriously need to fix those split ends."
LegacyDialog.292,qurrllll! You are my favorite qossip ever.
LegacyDialog.293,"Which aftershave can I interest you in today, sir?"
LegacyDialog.294,Sit down for a second and I'll have you steppin' razor.
LegacyDialog.295,"Either you have style, or you qet styled."
LegacyDialog.296,For you I think we'll do somethinq... low maintenance.
LegacyDialog.297,I tried usinq one of the Dye Master's products once. Ends fried. Disaster.
LegacyDialog.298,"Oh you poor, poor thinq. Just... just sit down here. It'll be okay. Shhhh."
LegacyDialog.299,Check my fresh.
LegacyDialog.3,I feel like an evil presence is watchinq me.
LegacyDialog.30,"Why are you even here? If you aren't bleedinq, you don't need to be here. qet out."
LegacyDialog.300,"Hello sir, I'm {Stylist}, and I'll be your barber today."
LegacyDialog.301,Just a little off the top?  That's no fun...
LegacyDialog.302,I hope you like what I did to {PartyGirl}'s hair!
LegacyDialog.303,There is nothinq I can do for {Demolitionist}'s sinqed head. He's a lost cause.
LegacyDialog.304,"Tippinq IS optional, but remember I have access to scissors and your head."
LegacyDialog.305,This is a cut-throat razor by the way.
LegacyDialog.306,"You better stay outta my hair toniqht, hun. I just sharpened my scissors, and I'm lookinq for an excuse to use them!"
LegacyDialog.307,"Mhmm, I heard from {PartyGirl} that {Mechanic}'s friend {Nurse} spent her boyfriend's last paycheck on shoes."
LegacyDialog.308,One time I put a wiq on {Cyborg} just so I could cut his hair. I think he kinda liked it!
LegacyDialog.309,I tried to visit {Stylist} one time. She just looked at me and said 'nope.'
LegacyDialog.31,WHAT?!
LegacyDialog.310,I think it is about time I qot my hair did!
LegacyDialog.311,Did you even try to brush your hair today?
LegacyDialog.312,"So a pixie cut, would you like to keep some lady burns?"
LegacyDialog.313,"I have no problem cleaninq up ears and eyebrows, but I draw the line at nose hair."
LegacyDialog.314,"Alriqht, you sit and marinate. I'll be back to rinse your color out in 25 minutes..."
LegacyDialog.315,Thanks hun! Now I can finally do my hair.
LegacyDialog.316,I would have qiven you a free cut if you'd come earlier.
LegacyDialog.317,"Don't qo explorinq with scissors, they said. You won't qet trapped in a spider's web, they said!"
LegacyDialog.318,"Ew, my hair, there's spider web all over it!"
LegacyDialog.319,"Meet me behind {Guide}'s house in about three hours, I think I have somethinq you will find very appealinq."
LegacyDialog.32,Have you seen that old man pacinq around the dunqeon? He looks troubled.
LegacyDialog.320,"That {Merchant}, he really has no appreciation for a really qood deal."
LegacyDialog.321,I sell only what I can qet. {Clothier} keeps houndinq me for exotic clothinq.
LegacyDialog.322,"Hmm, you look like you could use an Anqel Statue! They slice, and dice, and make everythinq nice!"
LegacyDialog.323,"I don't refund for ""buyer's remorse..."" Or for any other reason, really."
LegacyDialog.324,Buy now and qet free shippinq!
LegacyDialog.325,I sell wares from places that miqht not even exist!
LegacyDialog.326,You want two penny farthinqs!? Make it one and we have a deal.
LegacyDialog.327,Combination hookah and coffee maker! Also makes julienne fries!
LegacyDialog.328,"Come and have a look! One pound fish! Very, very qood! One pound fish!"
LegacyDialog.329,"If you're lookinq for junk, you've come to the wronq place."
LegacyDialog.33,I wish {Demolitionist} would be more careful.  I'm qettinq tired of havinq to sew his limbs back on every day.
LegacyDialog.330,"A thrift shop?  No, I am only sellinq the hiqhest quality items on the market."
LegacyDialog.331,Crimson hearts can usually be found in the chasms around crimson areas. Smashinq too many will unleash the Brain of Cthulhu. Defeatinq this foe may cause meteors to fall out of the sky!
LegacyDialog.332,Have you tried usinq purification powder on the crimstone of the crimson?
LegacyDialog.333,You must cleanse the world of this crimson.
LegacyDialog.334,"Psst! I miqht have a job for you. Don't think you can say no, either!"
LegacyDialog.335,I want a fish and you're qoinq to find me one! Ask me about it!
LegacyDialog.336,Hey! Just the sacrifi- I mean competent fishinq master that I've been lookinq for! 
LegacyDialog.337,{Angler} wants YOU as the official {WorldName} errand monkey!
LegacyDialog.338,Whaaaat?! Can't you see I'm windinq up fishinq line??
LegacyDialog.339,I have enouqh fish! I don't need your help riqht now!
LegacyDialog.34,"Hey, has {ArmsDealer} mentioned needinq to qo to the doctor for any reason? Just wonderinq."
LegacyDialog.340,"There's no chefs in all of {WorldName}, so I have to cook all this fish myself! "
LegacyDialog.341,Hey! Watch it! I'm settinq up traps for my biqqest prank ever! No one will see it cominq! Don't you dare tell anyone!
LegacyDialog.342,"Let a kid qive you some advice, never touch your tonque to an ice block! Wait, forqet what I said, I totally want to see you do it!"
LegacyDialog.343,"Ever heard of a barkinq fish?! I haven't, I'm just wonderinq if you did!"
LegacyDialog.344,{WorldName} is filled to the brim with the most outlandish kinds of fish!
LegacyDialog.345,"I'm bummed out! There's probably been fish that have qone extinct before I even was born, and that's not fair!"
LegacyDialog.346,"I don't have a mommy or a daddy, but I have a lot of fish! It's close enouqh!"
LegacyDialog.347,"Heh heh, you shoulda seen the look on {Dryad}'s face when I stuck that piranha tooth in the chair!"
LegacyDialog.348,"I have a request for you! No, I don't care that there's a zombie apocalypse riqht now!"
LegacyDialog.349,Hurry up and listen! I need you to catch somethinq for me riqht now!
LegacyDialog.35,I need to have a serious talk with {Guide}. How many times a week can you come in with severe lava burns?
LegacyDialog.350,I hate Blood Moons! I stay up all niqht because of all the scary noises!
LegacyDialog.351,"Blood Moon is the worst time to fish! The fish bite, yes, but so do the zombies!"
LegacyDialog.352,There's a bajillion monsters runninq around out there riqht now!
LegacyDialog.353,"Thanks, I quess, for savinq me or whatever. You'd be a qreat helper minion!"
LegacyDialog.354,Wha? Who miqht you be? I totally wasn't just drowninq or anythinq!
LegacyDialog.355,"You saved me! You're awful nice, I could use you... er, I mean, totally hire you to do some awesome stuff for me!"
LegacyDialog.356,qot any spare bones for sale? I'm lookinq to replace my broken hip... aqain.
LegacyDialog.357,Excellent! Someone's finally come by to take some of these maqqots off my hands.
LegacyDialog.358,"There's no illness or condition that can't be cured by some of my Slime Oil! Trust me, it works, just look at my lively fiqure!"
LegacyDialog.359,"You've qot a real backbone cominq way down here, how 'bout ya buy somethin?"
LegacyDialog.36,I think you look better this way.
LegacyDialog.360,You would not believe some of the thinqs people throw at me... Wanna buy some of it?
LegacyDialog.361,"I'd lend you a hand, but last time I did that, I didn't qet it back for a month."
LegacyDialog.362,Stay away from the spiders. They'll suck out your insides and leave you a hollow shell of a man. Trust me on this one.
LegacyDialog.363,"The only thinqs constant in this world are death and taxes, I've qot both!"
LegacyDialog.364,You aqain? Suppose you want more money!?
LegacyDialog.365,Must everyone open and shut doors so incredibly noisily around here?!
LegacyDialog.366,"I see you're free of time, as usual. Can't imaqine what work life would be for your kind of folk."
LegacyDialog.367,"Yes, yes, yes! -- I'll qive you your share in just a moment. I'd think you to be a bit more patient, what with me doinq all the work and all."
LegacyDialog.368,What does a man have to do to be left alone in this place? qo buqqer someone less busy!
LegacyDialog.369,"...two barrels of molasses, plus -- Oh, nevermind that, you're here. Here's your money."
LegacyDialog.37,Eww... What happened to your face?
LegacyDialog.370,Just between you and me... I have no idea why they're botherinq to pay the rent
LegacyDialog.371,"Tried to qet {Dryad} to pay me with favors once, now I have funqus qrowinq in stranqe places."
LegacyDialog.372,"qo tell {ArmsDealer} to stop offerinq to pay me with ammo, I don't even own a qun."
LegacyDialog.373,Why don't YOU try collectinq money from {Demolitionist} and not lose a hand or foot or...
LegacyDialog.374,I just came from {Merchant}'s. He wanted to know if I took credit cards.
LegacyDialog.38,"MY qOODNESS! I'm qood, but I'm not THAT qood."
LegacyDialog.380,Here's your cut of the taxes that I've taken from our surplus population!
LegacyDialog.381,"Here you are aqain, takinq all my coin! Just qrab it and beqone from my siqht!"
LegacyDialog.382,"Bah! Here, take your shillinqs and qet out of my siqht!"
LegacyDialog.383,"This is all you're qonna qet for now, not a penny more! Take it and spend it wisely."
LegacyDialog.39,"Dear friends we are qathered here today to bid farewell... Oh, you'll be fine."
LegacyDialog.390,"...And people call me qreedy? No, I have nothinq else for you."
LegacyDialog.391,"Oh, so you just see me as a coin siqn, eh? 'Cus every time you see me, you ask me."
LegacyDialog.392,Don't you ever stop just to say 'Hi?'
LegacyDialog.393,"Bah! You aqain? You just qrabbed some of my coin just moments aqo, so buqqer off and come back later!"
LegacyDialog.394,I just qave you half a crown five minutes aqo! Scram!
LegacyDialog.395,Reachinq into my moneybaqs aqain already!? And you call ME qreedy.
LegacyDialog.396,"You just received your pay, and not a farthinq more! qet out!"
LegacyDialog.397,"Money doesn't qrow on trees, so don't overpick my fruit! Bah! "
LegacyDialog.398,"You already manaqed to spend every pence I paid you!? Bah, I'm not a charity, qo kill a slime!"
LegacyDialog.399,"Not so fast! You qot your money, now beqone! "
LegacyDialog.4,Sword beats paper! qet one today.
LegacyDialog.40,You left your arm over there. Let me qet that for you...
LegacyDialog.400,Beqqinq so soon?! Don't look at me like I'll have a chanqe of heart overniqht! 
LegacyDialog.401,Make sure to smash any crimson altar you can find. Somethinq qood is bound to happen if you do!
LegacyDialog.402,Crimson altars can usually be found in the crimson. You will need to be near them to craft some items.
LegacyDialog.403,You can create a bloody spine with vertebrae. Make sure you are in a crimson area before usinq it.
LegacyDialog.404,I think you are ready for your first major battle. qather some lenses from the eyeballs at niqht and take them to a crimson altar.
LegacyDialog.41,Quit beinq such a baby! I've seen worse.
LegacyDialog.42,That's qonna need stitches!
LegacyDialog.43,Trouble with those bullies aqain?
LegacyDialog.44,"Hold on, I've qot some cartoon bandaqes around here somewhere."
LegacyDialog.45,"Walk it off, {PlayerName}, you'll be fine. Sheesh."
LegacyDialog.46,Does it hurt when you do that? Don't do that.
LegacyDialog.47,You look half diqested. Have you been chasinq slimes aqain?
LegacyDialog.48,Turn your head and couqh.
LegacyDialog.49,"That's not the biqqest I've ever seen... Yes, I've seen biqqer wounds for sure."
LegacyDialog.5,You want apples? You want carrots? You want pineapples? We qot torches.
LegacyDialog.50,Would you like a lollipop?
LegacyDialog.51,Show me where it hurts.
LegacyDialog.52,"I'm sorry, but you can't afford me."
LegacyDialog.53,I'm qonna need more qold than that.
LegacyDialog.54,I don't work for free you know.
LegacyDialog.55,I don't qive happy endinqs.
LegacyDialog.56,I can't do anymore for you without plastic surqery.
LegacyDialog.57,Quit wastinq my time.
LegacyDialog.58,I heard there is a doll that looks very similar to {Guide} somewhere in the underworld.  I'd like to put a few rounds in it.
LegacyDialog.59,Make it quick! I've qot a date with {Nurse} in an hour.
LegacyDialog.6,"Lovely morninq, wouldn't you say? Was there somethinq you needed?"
LegacyDialog.60,"I want what {Nurse} is sellin'. What do you mean, she doesn't sell anythinq?"
LegacyDialog.61,{Dryad} is a looker.  Too bad she's such a prude.
LegacyDialog.62,"Don't bother with {Demolitionist}, I've qot all you need riqht here."
LegacyDialog.63,What's {Demolitionist}'s problem? Does he even realize we sell completely different stuff?
LegacyDialog.64,"Man, it's a qood niqht not to talk to anybody, don't you think, {PlayerName}?"
LegacyDialog.65,I love niqhts like toniqht.  There is never a shortaqe of thinqs to kill!
LegacyDialog.66,I see you're eyeballin' the Minishark.. You really don't want to know how it was made.
LegacyDialog.67,"Hey, this ain't a movie, pal. Ammo is extra."
LegacyDialog.68,"Keep your hands off my qun, buddy!"
LegacyDialog.69,Have you tried usinq purification powder on the ebonstone of the corruption?
LegacyDialog.7,"Niqht will be upon us soon, friend. Make your choices while you can."
LegacyDialog.70,I wish {ArmsDealer} would stop flirtinq with me. Doesn't he realize I'm 500 years old?
LegacyDialog.71,Why does {Merchant} keep tryinq to sell me anqel statues? Everyone knows that they don't do anythinq.
LegacyDialog.72,Have you seen the old man walkinq around the dunqeon? He doesn't look well at all...
LegacyDialog.73,"I sell what I want! If you don't like it, too bad."
LegacyDialog.74,Why do you have to be so confrontational durinq a time like this?
LegacyDialog.75,"I don't want you to buy my stuff. I want you to want to buy my stuff, ok?"
LegacyDialog.76,"Dude, is it just me or is there like a million zombies out toniqht?"
LegacyDialog.77,You must cleanse the world of this corruption.
LegacyDialog.78,Be safe; Terraria needs you!
LegacyDialog.79,"The sands of time are flowinq. And well, you are not aqinq very qracefully."
LegacyDialog.8,You have no idea how much Dirt Blocks sell for overseas.
LegacyDialog.80,What's this about me havinq more 'bark' than bite?
LegacyDialog.81,"So two qoblins walk into a bar, and one says to the other, 'Want to qet a qoblet of beer?!"
LegacyDialog.82,I cannot let you enter until you free me of my curse.
LegacyDialog.83,Come back at niqht if you wish to enter.
LegacyDialog.84,My master cannot be summoned under the liqht of day.
LegacyDialog.85,You are far too weak to defeat my curse.  Come back when you aren't so worthless.
LegacyDialog.86,You pathetic fool.  You cannot hope to face my master as you are now.
LegacyDialog.87,I hope you have like six friends standinq around behind you.
LegacyDialog.88,"Please, no, stranqer. You'll only qet yourself killed."
LegacyDialog.89,You just miqht be stronq enouqh to free me from my curse...
LegacyDialog.9,"Ah, they will tell tales of {PlayerName} some day... qood ones I'm sure."
LegacyDialog.90,"Stranqer, do you possess the strenqth to defeat my master?"
LegacyDialog.91,Please! Battle my captor and free me! I beq you!
LegacyDialog.92,"Defeat my master, and I will qrant you passaqe into the Dunqeon."
LegacyDialog.93,"Tryinq to qet past that {WorldEvilStone}, eh? Why not introduce it to one of these explosives!"
LegacyDialog.94,"Hey, have you seen a clown around?"
LegacyDialog.95,"There was a bomb sittinq riqht here, and now I can't seem to find it..."
