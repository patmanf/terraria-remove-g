LegacyDialog.112,"T'were I younqer, I would ask {Nurse} out. I used to be quite the lady killer."
LegacyDialog.114,Thanks aqain for freeinq me from my curse. Felt like somethinq jumped up and bit me.

LegacyDialog.179,"Press {InventoryKey} to access your craftinq menu. When you have enouqh wood, create a workbench. This will allow you to create more complicated thinqs, as lonq as you are standinq close to it."
LegacyDialog.18,"Kosh, kapleck Moq. Oh sorry, that's klinqon for 'Buy somethinq or die.'"
LegacyDialog.180,You can build a shelter by placinq wood or other blocks in the world. Don't forqet to create and place walls.
LegacyDialog.181,"Once you have a wooden sword, you miqht try to qather some qel from the slimes. Combine wood and qel to make a torch!"
LegacyDialog.182,"To interact with backqrounds, use a hammer!"
LegacyDialog.183,You should do some mininq to find metal ore. You can craft very useful thinqs with it.
LegacyDialog.185,"You can create a furnace out of torches, wood, and stone. Make sure you are standinq near a work bench."
LegacyDialog.186,You will need an anvil to make most thinqs out of metal bars.
LegacyDialog.188,Underqround are crystal hearts which can be used to increase your max life. You can smash them with a pickaxe.
LegacyDialog.189,"If you qather 5 fallen stars, they can be combined to create an item that will increase your maqic capacity."
LegacyDialog.19,"{PlayerName} is it? I've heard qood thinqs, friend!"
LegacyDialog.190,"Stars fall all over the world at niqht. They can be used for all sorts of useful thinqs. If you see one, be sure to qrab it because they disappear after sunrise."
LegacyDialog.192,"In order for a room to be considered a home, it needs to have a door, a chair, a table, and a liqht source.  Make sure the house has walls as well."
LegacyDialog.194,You can use the housinq interface to assiqn and view housinq. Open your inventory and click the house icon.
LegacyDialog.195,"If you want a merchant to move in, you will need to qather plenty of money. 50 silver coins should do the trick!"
LegacyDialog.196,"For a nurse to move in, you miqht want to increase your maximum life."
LegacyDialog.197,"If you had a qun, I bet an arms dealer miqht show up to sell you some ammo!"
LegacyDialog.198,You should prove yourself by defeatinq a stronq monster. That will qet the attention of a dryad.
LegacyDialog.199,Make sure to explore the dunqeon thorouqhly. There may be prisoners held deep within.
LegacyDialog.2,Look at that shoddy armor you're wearinq. Better buy some more healinq potions.
LegacyDialog.200,Perhaps the old man by the dunqeon would like to join us now that his curse has been lifted.
LegacyDialog.201,Hanq on to any bombs you miqht find. A demolitionist may want to have a look at them.
LegacyDialog.202,Are qoblins really so different from us that we couldn't live toqether peacefully?
LegacyDialog.203,I heard there was a powerful wizard who lives in these parts.  Make sure to keep an eye out for him next time you qo underqround.
LegacyDialog.204,"If you combine lenses at a demon altar, you miqht be able to find a way to summon a powerful monster. You will want to wait until niqht before usinq it, thouqh."
LegacyDialog.205,You can create worm bait with rotten chunks and vile powder. Make sure you are in a corrupt area before usinq it.
LegacyDialog.207,"You can make a qrapplinq hook from a hook and 3 chains. Skeletons found deep underqround usually carry hooks, and chains can be made from iron bars or lead bars."
LegacyDialog.209,There is treasure hidden all over the world. Some amazinq thinqs can be found deep underqround!
LegacyDialog.21,"Anqel Statue you say? I'm sorry, I'm not a junk dealer."
LegacyDialog.210,Shadow orbs can usually be found in the chasms around corrupt areas. Smashinq too many will unleash the Eater of Worlds. Defeatinq this foe may cause meteors to fall out of the sky!
LegacyDialog.211,You should focus on qatherinq more life crystals to increase your maximum life.
LegacyDialog.213,I think you are ready for your first major battle. Qather some lenses from the eyeballs at niqht and take them to a demon altar.
LegacyDialog.214,You will want to increase your life before facinq your next challenqe. Fifteen hearts should be enouqh.
LegacyDialog.215,"The ebonstone in the corruption can be purified usinq some powder from a dryad, or it can be destroyed with explosives."
LegacyDialog.217,There is an old dunqeon not far from here. Now would be a qood time to qo check it out.
LegacyDialog.218,You should make an attempt to max out your available life. Try to qather twenty hearts.
LegacyDialog.219,"There are many treasures to be discovered in the junqle, if you are willinq to diq deep enouqh."
LegacyDialog.22,The last quy who was here left me some junk... er I mean... treasures!
LegacyDialog.220,The underworld is made of a material called hellstone. It's perfect for makinq weapons and armor.
LegacyDialog.221,"When you are ready to challenqe the keeper of the underworld, you will have to make a livinq sacrifice. Everythinq you need for it can be found in the underworld."
LegacyDialog.222,Make sure to smash any demon altar you can find. Somethinq qood is bound to happen if you do!
LegacyDialog.223,Souls can sometimes be qathered from fallen creatures in places of extreme liqht or dark.
LegacyDialog.224,"Ho ho ho, and a bottle of... Eqq Noq!"
LegacyDialog.226,What? You thouqht I wasn't real?
LegacyDialog.227,I manaqed to sew your face back on. Be more careful next time.
LegacyDialog.228,That's probably qoinq to leave a scar.
LegacyDialog.229,All better. I don't want to see you jumpinq off anymore cliffs.
LegacyDialog.23,"I wonder if the moon is made of cheese...huh, what? Oh yes, buy somethinq!"
LegacyDialog.231,"As if livinq underqround wasn't bad enouqh, jerks like you come in while I'm sleepinq and steal my children."
LegacyDialog.233,"I tried to lick myself the other day to see what the biq deal was, everythinq started qlowinq blue."
LegacyDialog.235,You haven't seen any piqs around here have you? My brother lost his leq to one.
LegacyDialog.236,Everyone in this town feels a bit off. I woke up to the clothier chewinq on my foot last niqht.
LegacyDialog.237,I'll qive you a discount on your wears if you can convince {Truffle} to come over for a...sizinq.
LegacyDialog.238,"I feel like {Truffle} is a bit misunderstood, he really is a fun quy."
LegacyDialog.24,Did you say qold?  I'll take that off of ya.
LegacyDialog.240,"I don't know the 'Truffle Shuffle,' so stop askinq!"
LegacyDialog.241,"There's been such a huqe rumor that's beinq spread about me, 'If you can't beat him, eat him!'"
LegacyDialog.242,"Oy, whatchu qot in you jiminy fluffer?"
LegacyDialog.243,Should I become an air pirate? I've considered becominq an air pirate.
LegacyDialog.245,"I'm feelinq a bit peevish as of late, so enouqh with your palaver you raqamuffin!"
LegacyDialog.246,I'm miqhty curious about that {Cyborg} fellow. By what manner of consumption does he maintain such locomotion?
LegacyDialog.248,Show me some qears!
LegacyDialog.249,I like your... qear. Does it come in brass?
LegacyDialog.25,You better not qet blood on me.
LegacyDialog.250,"Once you enter hallowed land, you will see a rainbow in the sky. I can help you with paintinq that if you want."
LegacyDialog.251,Check out {PartyGirl}. Now that's a qirl who can paint the town red!
LegacyDialog.252,I know the difference between turquoise and blue-qreen. But I won't tell you.
LegacyDialog.255,"No, no, no... There's TONS of different qrays! Don't qet me started..."
LegacyDialog.256,I hope it doesn't rain aqain until this paint dries. That would be a disaster!
LegacyDialog.257,I brinq you the richest colors in exchanqe for your riches!
LegacyDialog.258,"My dear, what you're wearinq is much too drab. You absolutely must take a lesson in dyeinq your tired attire!"
LegacyDialog.259,The only kind of wood I would bother dyeinq is RICH Mahoqany. Dyeinq any other wood is such a waste.
LegacyDialog.26,Hurry up and stop bleedinq.
LegacyDialog.260,"You must do somethinq about {Pirate}.  Everytime he comes over here, it takes me a week to qet the smell off!"
LegacyDialog.262,The heart of maqic is nature. The nature of hearts is maqic.
LegacyDialog.263,"{Nurse} may help heal your body, but I can make you embody healinq."
LegacyDialog.268,"Wow, {PlayerName}, meetinq an adventurous man like you makes me want to party!"
LegacyDialog.27,"If you're qoinq to die, do it outside."
LegacyDialog.271,"My name's {PartyGirl} but people call me party pooper. Yeah I don't know, it sounds cool thouqh."
LegacyDialog.276,"{PlayerName}, Ye be one o' the finest lookin' lassies this here captain's seen in many a fortniqht!"
LegacyDialog.277,"Stay off me booty, ya scallywaq!"
LegacyDialog.283,"So that 'punk' lookin' chick is an inventor, eh? I think I could show her a thinq or two!"
LegacyDialog.286,Sometimes I come off a bit... Qet it? a bit?
LegacyDialog.288,Those hiqhliqhts really brinq out your eyes!
LegacyDialog.290,Tea? Coffee? Or is it just oranqe juice aqain?
LegacyDialog.292,Qurrllll! You are my favorite qossip ever.
LegacyDialog.295,"Either you have style, or you qet styled."
LegacyDialog.296,For you I think we'll do somethinq... low maintenance.
LegacyDialog.297,I tried usinq one of the Dye Master's products once. Ends fried. Disaster.
LegacyDialog.298,"Oh you poor, poor thinq. Just... just sit down here. It'll be okay. Shhhh."
LegacyDialog.3,I feel like an evil presence is watchinq me.
LegacyDialog.30,"Why are you even here? If you aren't bleedinq, you don't need to be here. Qet out."
LegacyDialog.303,There is nothinq I can do for {Demolitionist}'s sinqed head. He's a lost cause.
LegacyDialog.304,"Tippinq IS optional, but remember I have access to scissors and your head."
LegacyDialog.306,"You better stay outta my hair toniqht, hun. I just sharpened my scissors, and I'm lookinq for an excuse to use them!"
LegacyDialog.308,One time I put a wiq on {Cyborg} just so I could cut his hair. I think he kinda liked it!
LegacyDialog.310,I think it is about time I qot my hair did!
LegacyDialog.313,"I have no problem cleaninq up ears and eyebrows, but I draw the line at nose hair."
LegacyDialog.314,"Alriqht, you sit and marinate. I'll be back to rinse your color out in 25 minutes..."
LegacyDialog.316,I would have qiven you a free cut if you'd come earlier.
LegacyDialog.317,"Don't qo explorinq with scissors, they said. You won't qet trapped in a spider's web, they said!"
LegacyDialog.319,"Meet me behind {Guide}'s house in about three hours, I think I have somethinq you will find very appealinq."
LegacyDialog.32,Have you seen that old man pacinq around the dunqeon? He looks troubled.
LegacyDialog.320,"That {Merchant}, he really has no appreciation for a really qood deal."
LegacyDialog.321,I sell only what I can qet. {Clothier} keeps houndinq me for exotic clothinq.
LegacyDialog.322,"Hmm, you look like you could use an Anqel Statue! They slice, and dice, and make everythinq nice!"
LegacyDialog.324,Buy now and qet free shippinq!
LegacyDialog.325,I sell wares from places that miqht not even exist!
LegacyDialog.326,You want two penny farthinqs!? Make it one and we have a deal.
LegacyDialog.328,"Come and have a look! One pound fish! Very, very qood! One pound fish!"
LegacyDialog.329,"If you're lookinq for junk, you've come to the wronq place."
LegacyDialog.33,I wish {Demolitionist} would be more careful.  I'm qettinq tired of havinq to sew his limbs back on every day.
LegacyDialog.330,"A thrift shop?  No, I am only sellinq the hiqhest quality items on the market."
LegacyDialog.331,Crimson hearts can usually be found in the chasms around crimson areas. Smashinq too many will unleash the Brain of Cthulhu. Defeatinq this foe may cause meteors to fall out of the sky!
LegacyDialog.332,Have you tried usinq purification powder on the crimstone of the crimson?
LegacyDialog.334,"Psst! I miqht have a job for you. Don't think you can say no, either!"
LegacyDialog.335,I want a fish and you're qoinq to find me one! Ask me about it!
LegacyDialog.336,Hey! Just the sacrifi- I mean competent fishinq master that I've been lookinq for! 
LegacyDialog.338,Whaaaat?! Can't you see I'm windinq up fishinq line??
LegacyDialog.339,I have enouqh fish! I don't need your help riqht now!
LegacyDialog.34,"Hey, has {ArmsDealer} mentioned needinq to qo to the doctor for any reason? Just wonderinq."
LegacyDialog.341,Hey! Watch it! I'm settinq up traps for my biqqest prank ever! No one will see it cominq! Don't you dare tell anyone!
LegacyDialog.342,"Let a kid qive you some advice, never touch your tonque to an ice block! Wait, forqet what I said, I totally want to see you do it!"
LegacyDialog.343,"Ever heard of a barkinq fish?! I haven't, I'm just wonderinq if you did!"
LegacyDialog.345,"I'm bummed out! There's probably been fish that have qone extinct before I even was born, and that's not fair!"
LegacyDialog.346,"I don't have a mommy or a daddy, but I have a lot of fish! It's close enouqh!"
LegacyDialog.348,"I have a request for you! No, I don't care that there's a zombie apocalypse riqht now!"
LegacyDialog.349,Hurry up and listen! I need you to catch somethinq for me riqht now!
LegacyDialog.350,I hate Blood Moons! I stay up all niqht because of all the scary noises!
LegacyDialog.352,There's a bajillion monsters runninq around out there riqht now!
LegacyDialog.353,"Thanks, I quess, for savinq me or whatever. You'd be a qreat helper minion!"
LegacyDialog.354,Wha? Who miqht you be? I totally wasn't just drowninq or anythinq!
LegacyDialog.356,Qot any spare bones for sale? I'm lookinq to replace my broken hip... aqain.
LegacyDialog.357,Excellent! Someone's finally come by to take some of these maqqots off my hands.
LegacyDialog.358,"There's no illness or condition that can't be cured by some of my Slime Oil! Trust me, it works, just look at my lively fiqure!"
LegacyDialog.359,"You've qot a real backbone cominq way down here, how 'bout ya buy somethin?"
LegacyDialog.360,You would not believe some of the thinqs people throw at me... Wanna buy some of it?
LegacyDialog.361,"I'd lend you a hand, but last time I did that, I didn't qet it back for a month."
LegacyDialog.363,"The only thinqs constant in this world are death and taxes, I've qot both!"
LegacyDialog.364,You aqain? Suppose you want more money!?
LegacyDialog.366,"I see you're free of time, as usual. Can't imaqine what work life would be for your kind of folk."
LegacyDialog.367,"Yes, yes, yes! -- I'll qive you your share in just a moment. I'd think you to be a bit more patient, what with me doinq all the work and all."
LegacyDialog.368,What does a man have to do to be left alone in this place? Qo bother someone less busy!
LegacyDialog.370,Just between you and me... I have no idea why they're botherinq to pay the rent.
LegacyDialog.371,"Tried to qet {Dryad} to pay me with favors once, now I have funqus qrowinq in stranqe places."
LegacyDialog.372,"Qo tell {ArmsDealer} to stop offerinq to pay me with ammo, I don't even own a qun."
LegacyDialog.373,Why don't YOU try collectinq money from {Demolitionist} and not lose a hand or foot or...
LegacyDialog.38,"MY QOODNESS! I'm qood, but I'm not THAT qood."
LegacyDialog.381,"Here you are aqain, takinq all my coin! Just qrab it and beqone from my siqht!"
LegacyDialog.382,"Bah! Here, take your shillinqs and qet out of my siqht!"
LegacyDialog.383,"This is all you're qonna qet for now, not a penny more! Take it and spend it wisely."
LegacyDialog.39,"Dear friends we are qathered here today to bid farewell... Oh, you'll be fine."
LegacyDialog.390,"...And people call me qreedy? No, I have nothinq else for you."
LegacyDialog.391,"Oh, so you just see me as a coin siqn, eh? 'Cus every time you see me, you ask me."
LegacyDialog.393,"Bah! You aqain? You just qrabbed some of my coin just moments aqo, so buqqer off and come back later!"
LegacyDialog.394,I just qave you half a crown five minutes aqo! Scram!
LegacyDialog.395,Reachinq into my moneybaqs aqain already!? And you call ME qreedy.
LegacyDialog.396,"You just received your pay, and not a farthinq more! Qet out!"
LegacyDialog.397,"Money doesn't qrow on trees, so don't overpick my fruit! Bah! "
LegacyDialog.398,"You already manaqed to spend every pence I paid you!? Bah, I'm not a charity, qo kill a slime!"
LegacyDialog.399,"Not so fast! You qot your money, now beqone! "
LegacyDialog.4,Sword beats paper! Qet one today.
LegacyDialog.40,You left your arm over there. Let me qet that for you...
LegacyDialog.400,Beqqinq so soon?! Don't look at me like I'll have a chanqe of heart overniqht! 
LegacyDialog.401,Make sure to smash any crimson altar you can find. Somethinq qood is bound to happen if you do!
LegacyDialog.403,You can create a bloody spine with vertebrae. Make sure you are in a crimson area before usinq it.
LegacyDialog.404,I think you are ready for your first major battle. Qather some lenses from the eyeballs at niqht and take them to a crimson altar.
LegacyDialog.41,Quit beinq such a baby! I've seen worse.
LegacyDialog.42,That's qonna need stitches!
LegacyDialog.43,Trouble with those bullies aqain?
LegacyDialog.44,"Hold on, I've qot some cartoon bandaqes around here somewhere."
LegacyDialog.47,You look half diqested. Have you been chasinq slimes aqain?
LegacyDialog.48,Turn your head and couqh.
LegacyDialog.49,"That's not the biqqest I've ever seen... Yes, I've seen biqqer wounds for sure."
LegacyDialog.5,You want apples? You want carrots? You want pineapples? We qot torches.
LegacyDialog.53,I'm qonna need more qold than that.
LegacyDialog.55,I don't qive happy endinqs.
LegacyDialog.56,I can't do anymore for you without plastic surqery.
LegacyDialog.57,Quit wastinq my time.
LegacyDialog.59,Make it quick! I've qot a date with {Nurse} in an hour.
LegacyDialog.6,"Lovely morninq, wouldn't you say? Was there somethinq you needed?"
LegacyDialog.60,"I want what {Nurse} is sellin'. What do you mean, she doesn't sell anythinq?"
LegacyDialog.62,"Don't bother with {Demolitionist}, I've qot all you need riqht here."
LegacyDialog.64,"Man, it's a qood niqht not to talk to anybody, don't you think, {PlayerName}?"
LegacyDialog.65,I love niqhts like toniqht.  There is never a shortaqe of thinqs to kill!
LegacyDialog.68,"Keep your hands off my qun, buddy!"
LegacyDialog.69,Have you tried usinq purification powder on the ebonstone of the corruption?
LegacyDialog.7,"Niqht will be upon us soon, friend. Make your choices while you can."
LegacyDialog.70,I wish {ArmsDealer} would stop flirtinq with me. Doesn't he realize I'm 500 years old?
LegacyDialog.71,Why does {Merchant} keep tryinq to sell me anqel statues? Everyone knows that they don't do anythinq.
LegacyDialog.72,Have you seen the old man walkinq around the dunqeon? He doesn't look well at all...
LegacyDialog.74,Why do you have to be so confrontational durinq a time like this?
LegacyDialog.76,"Dude, is it just me or is there like a million zombies out toniqht?"
LegacyDialog.79,"The sands of time are flowinq. And well, you are not aqinq very qracefully."
LegacyDialog.80,What's this about me havinq more 'bark' than bite?
LegacyDialog.81,"So two qoblins walk into a bar, and one says to the other, 'Want to qet a Qoblet of beer?!"
LegacyDialog.83,Come back at niqht if you wish to enter.
LegacyDialog.84,My master cannot be summoned under the liqht of day.
LegacyDialog.87,I hope you have like six friends standinq around behind you.
LegacyDialog.88,"Please, no, stranqer. You'll only qet yourself killed."
LegacyDialog.89,You just miqht be stronq enouqh to free me from my curse...
LegacyDialog.9,"Ah, they will tell tales of {PlayerName} some day... qood ones I'm sure."
LegacyDialog.90,"Stranqer, do you possess the strenqth to defeat my master?"
LegacyDialog.91,Please! Battle my captor and free me! I beq you!
LegacyDialog.92,"Defeat my master, and I will qrant you passaqe into the Dunqeon."
LegacyDialog.93,"Tryinq to qet past that {WorldEvilStone}, eh? Why not introduce it to one of these explosives!"
LegacyDialog.95,"There was a bomb sittinq riqht here, and now I can't seem to find it..."
LegacyDialog.96,I've qot somethinq for them zombies alriqht!
LegacyDialog.97,Even {ArmsDealer} wants what I'm sellinq!
LegacyDialog.98,Would you rather have a bullet hole or a qrenade hole? That's what I thouqht.
