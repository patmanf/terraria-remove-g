theres a shitty python script to go through the "All Localizations.csv" files that they usually upload on the forums with the changelogs and remove all Gs from it :)

theres another shtity python script to go through extracted language jsons and do the same thing, because All Localizations.csv isnt always updated with hotfixes lol
